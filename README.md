# Introduction

## Overview
ShahraZad is an innovative audiobook service that transforms any story or book into an engaging audio experience. It uses an **Emotional Text-to-Speech (ETTS)** system, which goes beyond simply reading the words. It analyzes the text, identifies emotions, and adjusts the narration accordingly, providing a more expressive and engaging experience.

In addition, ShahraZad features **voice cloning** technology, which allows books to be narrated in the voices of well-known narrators or even celebrities, offering a personalized touch for users.

The service also supports Arabic books, though the emotional feature is not yet available for this language.

## Features
